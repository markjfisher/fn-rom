# Analysis of fuji_dummy.s - Issues Found and Fixed

## Issues Identified:

### 1. **Incorrect Comment (Line 514)**
**WRONG:** "Update any new files to use fake RAM sectors (10+)"
- New files start at sector **5**, not 10+
- The function doesn't even assign sectors—MMFS does that
- **FIXED:** Updated comment to accurately describe what the function does

### 2. **Misleading Constant Name**
**ISSUE:** `RAM_FS_WORKSPACE_SIZE = $8` 
- Name suggests "workspace for filesystem operations"
- Actually just means "bytes before catalog starts" ($5000-$5007)
- Only $5000 is actively used (next_available_sector), $5001-$5007 are for debug
- **FIXED:** Renamed to `RAM_CATALOG_OFFSET` and added detailed memory layout comments

### 3. **Misleading Function Name**
**ISSUE:** `assign_ram_sectors_to_new_files`
- Name suggests it assigns sector numbers
- Actually only **marks RAM pages as allocated** based on sectors already assigned by MMFS
- **CORRECT:** Function scans catalog entries and marks their pages as "in use" for write operations

### 4. **Poor Encapsulation (osfile_helpers.s lines 175-179)**
**ISSUE:** High-level code directly manipulating `$5000`
```assembly
lda     $5000                   ; Direct manipulation
sta     pws_tmp03
inc     $5000
```
- Breaks encapsulation—core ROM shouldn't know dummy implementation details
- **FIXED:** Created `get_next_available_sector` function in fuji_dummy.s
- osfile_helpers.s now calls this function via proper API

## Changes Made:

### fuji_dummy.s:
1. ✅ Added export for `get_next_available_sector`
2. ✅ Replaced `RAM_FS_WORKSPACE_SIZE` with clearer `RAM_CATALOG_OFFSET`
3. ✅ Added detailed memory layout documentation ($5000-$5007)
4. ✅ Fixed misleading comment about sector 10+ → sector 5+
5. ✅ Clarified that function only marks pages, doesn't assign sectors
6. ✅ Implemented `get_next_available_sector()` function:
   - Reads NEXT_AVAILABLE_SECTOR ($5000)
   - Increments for next file
   - Returns sector in A register (caller stores in pws_tmp03)

### osfile_helpers.s:
1. ✅ Added conditional import of `get_next_available_sector` (DUMMY only)
2. ✅ Replaced direct `$5000` manipulation with function call
3. ✅ Improved code comments
4. ✅ Caller now stores result: `jsr get_next_available_sector / sta pws_tmp03`

## Memory Layout (Clarified):
```
$5000      - next_available_sector (1 byte, tracks next free sector)
$5001-5007 - Reserved for debug markers (7 bytes)
$5008-51FF - Catalog (512 bytes = 2 sectors)
$5200-51FF - Page allocation table (32 bytes)
$5220-523F - Page length table (32 bytes)  
$5240-5DFF - File data pages (12 pages × 256 bytes = 3KB)
```

## Verification:
✅ Code compiles cleanly
✅ Encapsulation properly maintained
✅ Comments now accurately reflect behavior
✅ Constant names are self-documenting
✅ Function doesn't know about pws_tmp03 (caller handles storage)
